- 👋 Hi, I’m @jessileegrimm
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D Art, Web3, NFTs, coding, traveling, and watching videos of animals.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 3D Art and Animation on Blender, Lean Six Sigma strategies from Villanova, and Full Stack Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3D Art, NFT projects, or even learning to code together by doing small projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: It's honestly the easiest to reach me on my socials.<p>
